Developing Data Products: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch

This web application is built to study the k means clustering procedure in the mtcars dataset. The user specifies the x and y variables which defines the scatterplot. The user can vary the number of clusters for the k means procedure in order to find similar patterns in the dataset, a way of exploring the subtle bivariate commonalities present among the features in the given data.
